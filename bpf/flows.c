/*
    Flows v2.
    Flow monitor: A Flow-metric generator using TC.

    This program can be hooked on to TC ingress/egress hook to monitor packets
    to/from an interface.

    Logic:
        1) Store flow information in a per-cpu hash map.
        2) Upon flow completion (tcp->fin event), evict the entry from map, and
           send to userspace through ringbuffer.
           Eviction for non-tcp flows need to done by userspace
        3) When the map is full, we send the new flow entry to userspace via ringbuffer,
            until an entry is available.
        4) When hash collision is detected, we send the new entry to userpace via ringbuffer.
